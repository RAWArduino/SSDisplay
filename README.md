#### 7-Segment Display (SSDisplay)

*SSDisplay* is a library to control common-cathode and common-anode 7-segment displays directly from Arduino without any external integrated circuit. At first, it implements the main functionalities of a LED 7-segment display, controlling digits and decimal points exhibition. However, you may extend *SSDisplay* to meet your needs, given that it has similarity with template-method pattern. Thus, you can override the hook methods `onShow()` and `onHide()` to extend its functionalities when LEDs turn on or off, respectively. This is useful if your display has peculiarities like colons or apostrophe.

Keep in mind that the main aim of this library is prototyping and study. Furthermore, such a project doesn't use third party libraries and is compliant with *PlatformIO* requirements.
